- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in getting my first job like dev, but now im not have experience more than the skills that I got in the university. That is why now im looking for a job like Trainee/JR, to get more experience and get better my skills as a dev.
In my last repos you can find all of my jobs. Some were made in the university and others were made by myself to get some of experience. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some of Python in the subject "Estructuras de Datos".
